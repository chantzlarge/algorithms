## TL;DR

* The purpose of this repository is to serve as an educational resource and reference about algorithms
* Programmers new to open-source are encouraged to use this repository to learn about contributing to open-source projects

## Contributing

The vision for this project is to establish a bank of algorithms implemented in various programming languages for reference and education. Initially, many of these algorithms will be implemented from the popular book, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844). If you're interested in contributing to this project:

* [Create an Issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)
* [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

In addition to source code contributions, I intend to include Wiki pages describing algorithms and their properties (i.e. time complexity) which is open for contribution as well.
